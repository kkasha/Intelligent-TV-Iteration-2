# Intelligent-TV-Iteration-2
A system that can pause TV when kids watch up close

The idea is to actually pause the TV when kids are near. This involves first cracking the codes that the remote sends & TV understands as "pause". The second step is to reproduce that signal programmatically so as to actually pause the TV.

The code of the program is in the python file Intelligent TV Iteration 2
The profile of my TCL Roku TV is in the file lircd.conf
